// This example contains a TAP plugin with simulated instrument and DUT. It shows 
// the basic interaction between Test Steps, DUTs, and Instruments. More detail 
// on the features found in the example can be found in the PluginDevelopment directory.

// The project includes a SIMULATED: 
// -   GeneratorInstrument (TAP Instrument).
// -   LowPassFilterDut (TAP DUT).

// MeasurePeakAmplitudeTestStep (this file) is a TAP Test Step that:
// 1.	Programs the generator.
// 2.	Configures the low pass filter.
// 3.	Collects the results from the low pass filter.  
// 4.  Publishes results to any configured result listeners.
